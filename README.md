# Cross-Generation Analysis of Social Media Behavior

This project explores how social media affects people differently across generations, with a particular focus on behavior, attention span, and cognitive trends. By analyzing collected survey data and visualizing patterns, the project aims to uncover generational distinctions in how social platforms are used and experienced.


## Project Overview

Social media has become a ubiquitous part of modern life, but its impact isn't uniform across age groups. This study investigates:

- How different generations engage with platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube
- Variations in screen time, content preference, and emotional response
- The effect of short-form video content on attention span
- Generational differences in perceived benefits vs. drawbacks of social media


## Objectives

- Compare behavioral trends among Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, and Boomers
- Visualize data to uncover generational usage patterns
- Interpret findings for potential implications in education, design, and mental health research
