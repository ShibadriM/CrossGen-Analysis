This project explores the behavioral impact and usage patterns of social media across different generations, such as Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, and Boomers. By combining survey data, statistical techniques, and visualizations, it provides insights into how attention span, cognitive preferences, and emotional responses differ with social media use among age groups.

Key features:

-Data collection via structured surveys and/or publicly available datasets

-Statistical and trend analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, etc.)

-Comparative visualizations of social media impact across age groups

-Insights into short-form video influence on attention span and engagement

-Includes a research-style report summarizing key findings and interpretations

This project aims to provide a foundation for further research or policy discussions around the psychological and societal effects of digital media consumption.
